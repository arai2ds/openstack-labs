### THURSDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to show students how to launch a Heat stack.

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a terminal session, and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. Confirm that the python-openstackclient is not currently installed. To be clear, the following command should fail.

    `student@controller:~$` `source admin.rc`

0. First, let's confirm that Heat is available. The following command should return an empty line.

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack stack list`

0. Okay, great. Now let's prepare to creat a stack. Retrieve the list of available flavors on your system (this is review).

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack flavor list`
    
0. Continuing to create our stack. Retrieve the list of available images on your system (this is review).

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack image list`
    
0. After we launch an instance with Heat, you'll want to be able to SSH into with a keypair. Let's produce a key just for use with our machines created with Heat (this is review).

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack keypair create heat_key > heat_key.priv`
    
0. Change the permissions on the key we created, so that it is usable.

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `chmod 600 heat_key.priv`

0. We've already created a Heat template for use with this lab. Download it, and inspect it.

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `curl http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/heat-templates/plain/hot/F20/WordPress_Native.yaml`
    
 0. Run the stack.
 
    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack stack create -t http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/heat-templates/plain/hot/F20/WordPress_Native.yaml --parameter key_name=heat_key --parameter image_id=cirros --parameter instance_type=m1.small teststack`
 
 0. It failed. Troubleshoot why.
 
    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack stack event list teststack`
    
0. What was the reason?

0. Two ways to fix this. We could pass a paramater with subnet indicating the network we want to use, or fix the template. Let's try both.
