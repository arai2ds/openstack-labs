### THURSDAY - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to show students how to launch a Heat stack.

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a terminal session, and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Confirm that the python-openstackclient is not currently installed. To be clear, the following command should fail.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `openstack`

0. You **DO NOT** need to run the following command. This is a prerequisite step that install python, so it is included, but python has already been installed (it typically is installed with Linux distros). If you do run it, you'll be prompted for a password; use **CTRL + C** to escape.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo apt install python-dev python-pip`
