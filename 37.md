### THURSDAY - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to learn to deploy the python-openstackclient. API endpoints are interacted with via python-clients. There are many "one-off" clients that target a single OpenStack project's APIs, however one OpenStack python-client seeks to 'rule them all'. This client is known as the python-openstackclient.

The following link demonstrates the installation process on other computing platforms (Windows, Mac OS, and various Linux distros), in addition to explaining how to install other "one-off" clients: https://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a terminal session, and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Confirm that the python-openstackclient is not currently installed. To be clear, the following command should fail.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `openstack`
